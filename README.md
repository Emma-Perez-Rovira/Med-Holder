# Med-Holder
A modular medicine bottle holder.

Will be able to hold both the larger bottle and the thinner bottle (50mm diameter and 32mm diameter respectively). Can be hung on a wall, or a desk.
Has space for two switches, so that you can quickly and visually tell if you have taken your dose yet.
